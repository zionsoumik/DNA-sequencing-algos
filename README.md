# DNA-sequencing-algos
A study of the different DNA sequencing algorithms and to make the comparative study of the different algorithms and to find 
out the efficiency of the different algorithms namely Needleman and FASTA based on that. My job was to write a Java program 
and implement these algorithms and find the efficiency of these algorithms on different data sets and their behavior.

The outfiles are the data that we have actually found out
